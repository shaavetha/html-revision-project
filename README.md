Practicing HTML fundamentals through FreeCodeCamp's Cat Photo App project

# Cat Photo App – FreeCodeCamp Practice Project

This is a basic HTML project built as part of FreeCodeCamp's **Responsive Web Design Certification**.

## Purpose
I’m currently revising core web development skills by rebuilding foundational projects. This one helps practice pure HTML structure without any CSS or JavaScript.

## Skills Practiced
- HTML tags: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<input>`, `<form>`, etc
- Creating a semantic, accessible page layout
- Linking images and text content properly
- Using placeholder content to simulate real-world structure

## Source
This follows **Module 1** from FreeCodeCamp:

## Notes
This project reinforces the basics of HTML and helps keep my fundamentals strong as I move into testing and cybersecurity projects.
